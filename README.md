The slides use the Obsidian Plugin [advanced slides](https://github.com/MSzturc/obsidian-advanced-slides).

The demo can be ran by self-hosting pocketbase, and placing the [migration](./demo/migrations.js) in a `pb_migrations` folder next to your pocketbase binary.

Feel free to [reach out](https://ghostdev.xyz/contact/) if you have any issues!
